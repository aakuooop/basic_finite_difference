# basic_finite_difference
Parabolic folder contains the code written for the example problem (Couette flow problem, Page No. 67) from Chapter 3 of the textbook "Computational Fluid
Dynamics Vol - I " by Hoffmann and Chiang. Four different finite difference schemes are adopted to solve this problem. The given methods are explained 
in this book in great detail. Refer page 60 to learn about different schemes. These codes are developed for educational purposes.
