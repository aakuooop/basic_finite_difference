These codes are developed for educational purposes. Written for the example problems of the textbook "Computational Fluid Dynamics Vol - I " by Hoffmann and Chiang. Thomas algorithm to solve tridiagonal systems of equations is also included (document & code). 
# Parabolic
Couette flow problem, Page No. 67 from Chapter 3. Go to page 60 to learn about the different schemes used in these codes.  

# Elliptic
Contains the codes written for the example problem for elliptic equations (**Page No. 167 referred in the code as CH5_P1,CH5_P2,CH_P3,CH5_P4,CH5_P5 & CH5_P6** and **Problem 5.1,5.2 & 5.3 denoted in the code as P5_1,P5_2 and P5_3 respectively, Page No. 175**) from Chapter 5. Different methods such as point Gauss-Siedel iteration method, line Gauss-Siedel, PSOR, LSOR, Alternation Direction Implicit (ADI) method and AADI are used to solve 2D elliptic PDEs. Go to page 152 to learn different methods used in these codes.  

# Hyperbolic
Refer example problem 6.5 (page 191) referred as **CH6_P1** in the code, another example problem (chapter 6, page 200) referred as **CH6_P2** in the code, non-linear problem 6.6 (Page 206) denoted as **CH6_P3** in the code, application of linear damping 6.7.1 (page 231) referred as **CH6_p4**, application of flux corrected transport 6.8.1-**CH6_P5** (Page 236), Page 243 - application of TVD 6.10.3 (**CH6_P6**) and problems 6.13 (page 254) - 6.1 as **CH6_P6_1**, 6.2 as **CH6_P6_2**, 6.3 as **CH6_P6_3**. Methods applied to solve hyperbolic problems can be found in page 185 (Chapter 6).
