These codes are developed for educational purposes.
# Parabolic
This folder contains the code written for the example problem (Couette flow problem, Page No. 67) from Chapter 3 of the textbook "Computational Fluid
Dynamics Vol - I " by Hoffmann and Chiang. Four different finite difference schemes are adopted to solve this problem. The given methods are explained 
in this book in great detail. Go to page 60 to learn about the different schemes used in these codes.  

# Elliptic
1. Elliptic/problem1 folder contains the code written for the example problem for elliptic problem (Page No. 167) from Chapter 5 of the textbook "Computational Fluid Dynamics Vol - I " by Hoffmann and Chiang.  Different methods such as point Gauss-Siedel iteration method, line Gauss-Siedel, PSOR, LSOR, Alternation Direction Implicit (ADI) method and AADI are used to solve the 2D heat conduction equation. Go to page 152 of this book for detailed explanation and formulation of these methods.
