These codes are developed for educational purposes. Written for the example problems of the textbook "Computational Fluid Dynamics Vol - I " by Hoffmann and Chiang.
# Parabolic
Couette flow problem, Page No. 67 from Chapter 3. Go to page 60 to learn about the different schemes used in these codes.  

# Elliptic
Contains the codes written for the example problem for elliptic equations (**Page No. 167 referred in the code as P1,P2,P3,P4,P5 & P6** and **Problem 5.1,5.2 & 5.3 denoted in the code as P5_1,P5_2 and P5_3 respectively, Page No. 175**) from Chapter 5. Different methods such as point Gauss-Siedel iteration method, line Gauss-Siedel, PSOR, LSOR, Alternation Direction Implicit (ADI) method and AADI are used to solve 2D elliptic PDEs. Go to page 152 to learn different methods used in these codes.
